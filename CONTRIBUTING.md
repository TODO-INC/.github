# TODO Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to TODO! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve our projects and make a positive impact together. Before you get started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and collaborative contribution process.

## Code of Conduct

Before contributing, please read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to follow these guidelines to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment within our community.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**
   To get started, fork the repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the project under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   
     git clone https://github.com/TODO-INC/repository-name.git
   
   ```
   Replace `repository-name` with the name of the repository.

4. **Create a New Branch**
Before making any changes, create a new branch in your local repository to work on your contributions:
  ```

    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

  ```
Please use a descriptive branch name that reflects the changes you're making.

4. **Make Changes**
Now you can make your desired changes and improvements to the codebase. Ensure that your changes are in line with the project's purpose and style guidelines.

5. **Commit and Push**
Once you've made your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message:
 ```

  git add .
  git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"

  ```
  Then, push the changes to your forked repository:
  ```

  git push origin feature/your-feature-name

  ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
Go to the original repository on GitHub and navigate to the `Pull Requests` tab. Click on `New Pull Request` and select your branch from the dropdown.
Ensure that you provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes in the pull request. If your contribution addresses any existing issues, reference them in the description.

7. **Review and Collaboration**
Once your pull request is submitted, our team will review your changes and provide feedback if necessary. We may request further modifications before merging your contribution.

We appreciate your effort in making TODO even better! Thank you for contributing to our community.
